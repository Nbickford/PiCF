PiCF Quick Guide-

PiCF is a program for computing continued fractions of any number between 1 and 10 very quickly. It can be used for breaking world records, partial verification, and much more.

*******************
System Requirements
*******************
At least 32MB of RAM to do anything worthwhile;
At least 32MB of hard drive space to store small continued fractions;
Note-you will need more in order to store larger continued fractions.

***************
Getting Started
***************

To start using PiCF, simply extract the contents of the zip into another folder anywhere on your system except for inside C:\Windows\. Then run PiCF.exe.

Example of Use
**************
Here's how to make a simple continued fraction using PiCF. 
In this tutorial, we will create a slightly less than 1000-term long continued fraction of pi.
First, go into the settings menu and change these settings:
Filename should be smallpi.txt
Power should be 1000
Precision should be 4000
Increments to display should be 100
Read Blocks should be 100

Then, go back to the main menu and press 3 to get into the compute menu. After that, press "y" to start the computation. The total time should be less than 1 second to compute. Afterwards, press "n" on the verification prompt and press enter to exit. Open up output.txt in a file viewer, and the result should look something like this:
3
7
15
1
292
...
Congratulations, you've made your first continued fraction.

If you need more help, you can get it from the "help" menu.

TODO
****

Needed:
Output in Ascii, not Unicode
Add 32-bit support

Useful:
Add switch to generate FromContinuedFraction at end
Minimize memory use: Although it may not be as bad as Mathematica, it still gobbles up memory like Cookie Monster.
Add GUI: Because some people are scared of command lines.
Fix decimal point problem-e^pi is interesting too!

Maybe later:
Multi-core utilization
Recode in C++ - GMP isn't as fast as it should be!
Switch from lists to arrays - I have no idea why this isn't in.
